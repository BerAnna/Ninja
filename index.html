			Splinter has three origin stories, and which one is used depends on the medium. In the original version of the tale, he is Hamato Yoshi's pet. In other versions he is Hamato Yoshi himself, but always mutated into the form of a human-sized rat. In one film version, he is a mutant rat with no connection to Yoshi.</p>
